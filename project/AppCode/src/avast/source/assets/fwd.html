		1) seriously weird, but meta refresh doesn't seem to work when the html is loaded, but
		works on back button press and vice versa, the javascript works on page load, but not on
		back button press, javascript probably might not be loaded when the page is taken from cache
		on back button press
		2) the onLoad function doesn't seem to work in some cases, therefore a second script
		inside the body is provided
		3) window.location.replace doesn't work for an uknown reason - tried on emulator 2.1
