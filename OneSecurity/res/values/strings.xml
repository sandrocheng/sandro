    <string name="help_system_setting_2" formatted="false">\nPrivacy Statement for Tencent One Security Software
\nLast updated: [2013-1-18]
\nTencent Mobile Doctor Ltd (“Tencent” or “we”) is committed to protecting your privacy while providing you with the products and services that serve your needs. The operation of these products and services may require the collection and use of your personal information. This privacy statement explains how Tencent collects and uses your personal information by the Software ("Software") in those situations. This privacy statement only applies to the Software and Services and does not apply to other Tencent websites, products or services (for clarity, all references to “Software” in this Privacy Statement also refer to the Services, unless the context requires otherwise). Please read the following Privacy Statement to understand how Tencent uses any information collected from you through your use of the Software.
\nThis Privacy Statement is current as of the “last updated” date set forth above. Tencent reserves the right to change this statement from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. Updated versions of this Privacy Statement will also be available in future updates to the Software.
\nBy installing or using the Software, you acknowledge, agree and consent that your Personal Information (as defined below) will be handled as described in this Privacy Statement, which is incorporated by reference into the Software End User License and Services Agreement for Tencent One Security Software (“EULA”).
\nIt is your responsibility to read and accept the terms of service and privacy policies for the websites you visit. Tencent is not responsible for the privacy practices of other entities, including websites whose advertisements may appear on the Software.  This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by Tencent with your use of the Software.
\nWhere there is any inconsistency between the English and any other language versions of this Privacy Statement, the English version will prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.
\nDefined terms in this Privacy Statement, if not defined in this Privacy Statement, have the meaning as given under the EULA.
\nINFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU
\nWhat information Tencent collects or receives from you depends on how you use the Software, which may include the following:
\nYour Personal Information
\n"Personal Information" is information that you provide to Tencent which personally identifies you, such as your name, telephone number, identification number, email address, or credit card details. When you provide your Personal Information to Tencent using the Software, Tencent receives and stores this information in order to respond to your instructions and requests. For example, we may use your Personal Information when providing you with customer technical support. You can choose not to provide your Personal Information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of all the features in the Software.
\nNon-Personal Information
\n"Non-Personal Information" is information that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. Non-Personal Information includes but is not limited to your computer’s configuration and the version of the Software you are using.
\nInformation We Collect Automatically 
\nWe receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, we automatically send and receive information to and from your mobile device which we use to determine which version of the Software you are using so that we may automatically update (new features, bug fixes, etc.) the Software and Services that you may use. Like many mobile applications, the Software may collect any personal information that you have inputted into your mobile device when you use the Software (for example, by using the address book synchronization function of the Software). The Software also supports the use of automated tools to obtain certain types of information to make your usage of the Software more convenient. Though such information will typically be used in an aggregated way to improve our products and services, some information we collect, including your usage patterns or preferences, may be used to personalize your experience, or to offer you products and services specifically based on your preferences and usage.
\nIn addition, our servers automatically recognize your IP address and other technical information about your mobile device. See the section below entitled “IP Address Information” for more information.
\nAll information received and stored as the aforesaid will be encrypted to ensure the personal data security and will be sent through a digital certificate encryption channel during data exchange between clients and servers with valid security certificates for websites and mobile clients. All local back-up information is encrypted and saved to protect the Licensee’s personal information if the Licensee loses the mobile device. However, Tencent, its affiliates, employees, officers and agents shall not be liable for any loss of information of the Licensee.
\n
\nIP Address Information
\nEach time you use the Software, your wireless telecom services operator will provide our web server with your IP address, as well as other technical information about your mobile device. In addition, our servers may look up the IP address and other information about your mobile device so that Tencent can: 1) display specific or localized content and advertisements that may interest you based on the geographic location of handheld device, or 2) to enable certain features of the Software. We do not combine your IP address or location information with personally identifiable information about you.
\nHOW TENCENT USES YOUR INFORMATION
\nTencent may use the information we collect about you for any of the following purposes:  
\n•	To carry out Software or Service-related verification, upgrade, security or customer support purposes.

\n
\nWe will honor your request to not use your Personal Information for all or any of the marketing purposes noted above.  If you do not wish to receive offers or advertising from us or only wish to receive certain offers or advertising, please notify our Privacy Officer at cs@theonesecurity.com.
\nWe do not sell or rent your Personal Information to any third party, but we may disclose information about you to third parties acting on our behalf or who are our Affiliates (as defined in the EULA). These third parties may assist Tencent with marketing, resolving service problems, and correcting errors related to the execution of Tencent’s products including the Software.  However, we do not give these third parties (other than our subsidiaries and affiliates) an independent right to share or use your personal information. Such disclosure is further described in the below section.
\nIn addition, we may from time to time disclose Non-Personal Information to any third parties as at our discretion.
\nHOW AND WHEN TENCENT SHARES INFORMATION
\nInformation about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as compatible with the purposes described above, and when we have your permission or as described in this section.
\nTencent Affiliates 
\nWe may share your information with our Affiliates (as defined in the EULA) but only if those Affiliates are either subject to this Privacy Statement or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Statement.

Examples include without limitation sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance (including data concerning marketing and promotional programs), or providing customer service or for other purposes within the ordinary course of business. These third parties, which may be located outside of your jurisdiction, have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions on our behalf. We require these companies to agree (ⅰ) to provide adequate protections for your Personal Information that are no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy and (ⅱ) to use your Personal Information only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by us. Tencent or its affiliates are not liable for the acts or omissions of these third parties, except as provided by applicable law.
\nBusiness Transfers
\nAs Tencent continues to develop our business, we might sell or buy online stores, subsidiaries, or other businesses. In such transactions, customer information generally would be one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy statement or policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that Tencent, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, we will provide notice before customer information, including your Personal Information, is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy statement or policy.
\nProtection of Tencent
\nTencent reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we believe such disclosure are required to comply with the law, judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process; to enforce or apply the terms of the EULA; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Tencent, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction purposes. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing Personal Information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of this Privacy Statement.

\nWe may retain any Personal Information collected from you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes as outlined in this Privacy Statement unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law.

\nWe work to protect the security of your Personal Information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you provide to Tencent while using the Software.
