		    JavaMail(TM) API 1.4.7 release
		    ------------------------------

Welcome to the 1.4.7 release of the JavaMail API implementation. 

Please refer to CHANGES.txt for a list of the changes since the 
previous release.

Please see the FAQ at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/faq/

Protocol Providers
------------------

The JavaMail API jar file "mail.jar" includes the full JavaMail API
implementation and the Sun protocol providers - IMAP, SMTP, and
POP3.  The simplest way to use the JavaMail API is to just use the
mail.jar file and ignore the other jar files in this package.

In some cases it may be desirable to minimize the size of the JavaMail
API code used by an application (e.g., when downloading with an applet).
In this case you might want to include the "mailapi.jar" file, which
includes *no* protocol providers, along with just the jar file for the
protocol provider you need.  For example, an applet that only needs to
send mail could use the "mailapi.jar" file and the "smtp.jar" file.

An important note when using the separate protocol provider jar files:

-  You can't mix and match the Sun protocol providers between different
   releases of the JavaMail API.  The Sun protocol providers depend on
   implementation-specific utility APIs within the mailapi.jar file.
   (Third party protocol providers that don't depend on these APIs
   should work fine.)


NOTE: The Sun protocol provider documentation is available in javadoc format,
      see docs/javadocs/index.html in the directory where you extracted
      the JavaMail API zip file.  This documentation describes how to
      use features of the Sun protocol providers to directly access
      some features of the SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 protocols that are
      not otherwise supported by the standard JavaMail API.


Gmail IMAP Provider
-------------------

This release includes an EXPERIMENTAL Gmail IMAP provider.
Normal use of Gmail is handled by the standard "imap" protocol
provider, but the new "gimap" protocol provider supports additional
Gmail-specific non-standard features.  See the javadocs for the
com.sun.mail.gimap package for details.  Note that the gimap.jar file
needs to be added to your CLASSPATH to use this new provider.


SASL Support
------------

On systems that support the Java SASL API (javax.security.sasl, JSR-28),
such as J2SE 5.0 and later, the IMAP provider can use the SASL API to
find an appropriate authentication mechanism.  The SASL API also allows
you to plug in support for custom authentication mechanisms.  See The
Java SASL API Programming and Deployment Guide at
http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/sasl/sasl-refguide.html
for details on developing custom SASL mechanisms.  See the javadocs for
the com.sun.mail.imap package for the properties required to enable and
configure SASL support.


DSN Support
-----------

This release of JavaMail includes EXPERIMENTAL support for creating
and parsing Delivery Status Notifications, as defined by RFC 3462
and RFC 3464.  To make use of this support you need to include dsn.jar
in your CLASSPATH along with mail.jar.  See the javadocs for the
com.sun.mail.dsn package for more details.

The DSN package also provides support for creating and parsing Message
Disposition Notifications, as defined by RFC 3798.

The APIs unique to this package should be considered EXPERIMENTAL.
They may be changed in the future in ways that are incompatible with
applications using the current APIs.


NTLM Support
------------

This release of JavaMail includes EXPERIMENTAL support for the
Microsoft NTLM authentication mechanism used by Exchange.  See the
file NTLMNOTES.txt for details.


OSGi Support
------------

The JavaMail jar files are now OSGi bundles.  Please let us know
of any problems using JavaMail with OSGi.


How to submit bug reports
-------------------------

If you've found a bug, or if you just need help figuring out how to use
the JavaMail API, please try to include the following information in
your message to us:

    - a program or code snippet that shows the problem
    - the platform you are using
    - the mail server (vendor name, version number) you are using
    - your environment variable settings
    - a stack trace, if appropriate
    - a protocol trace, after turning on session debugging, if appropriate

Most of the problems reported to us fail to include enough of the above
information to allow us to diagnose your problem.  It will save you and
us time if you include this information in your first message to us.

By far the most common problems we see are:

Your problem:	Something doesn't work right when talking to my mail server.
Our response:	Turn on session debugging and send us the protocol trace.
		See the demo program documentation for how to turn on
		session debugging for the demo programs.  In your own
		program, call "session.setDebug(true);".

Your problem:	javax.mail or javax.activation classes not found when compiling.
Our response:	You didn't set CLASSPATH correctly to find mail.jar and
		activation.jar.  See README.txt.

Your problem:	NoSuchProviderException - No such provider for rfc822.
Our response:	You unjar'ed mail.jar.  Don't.

Your problem:	How do I create a message with an attachment?
Our response:	Create a message with a MimeMultipart content.  See the
		sendfile.html and msgmultisendsample.java demo programs.

A list of the known limitations, bugs, issues:
----------------------------------------------

1. This version of JavaMail will only work in applets when using
   the Java(TM) Plug-in
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-141438.html),
   which is part of the current Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
   available from Oracle at:
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

2. Internationalization.  Parameter encoding in MIME headers, as
   specified by RFC2231, *has* been implemented.  Note that
   this covers only certain special cases not covered by the MIME
   specification.  MIME specifies encoding of text in the Subject
   and address headers, and JavaMail fully supports such encoding.
   Most mailers don't support RFC2231.

   To enable RFC2231 support in parameter lists, set the System
   properties mail.mime.encodeparameters and mail.mime.decodeparameters
   to "true".

3. We've received reports of IMAP authentication failures on the
   Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, enterprise edition. This is due to
   a bug in the Microsoft server and the "Service Pack 1 for Exchange 
   Server 5.5" apparently fixes this server bug. The service pack can
   be downloaded from the Microsoft website.

4. Due to a problem in the Microsoft Exchange IMAP server, insufficient
   number of bytes may be retrieved when reading big messages. There
   are two ways to workaround this Exchange bug:

   (a) The Exchange IMAP server provides a configuration option called
       "fast message retrieval" to the UI.  Simply go to the site, server
       or recipient, click on the "IMAP4" tab, and one of the check boxes
       is "enable fast message retrieval".  Turn it off and the octet 
       counts will be exact.  This is fully described at
       http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q191504

   (b) Set the "mail.imap.partialfetch" property to false. You'll have 
       to set this property in the Properties object that you provide to 
       your Session.

5. Certain IMAP servers do not implement the IMAP Partial FETCH 
   functionality properly. This problem typically manifests as corrupt
   email attachments when downloading large messages from the IMAP 
   server. To workaround this server bug, set the 
	"mail.imap.partialfetch" 
   property to false. You'll have to set this property in the Properties
   object that you provide to your Session.
